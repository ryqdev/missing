# Financial Basic

## Secirities

Securities are fungible and tradable financial instruments used to raise capital in public and private markets. There are primarily three types of securities: 
1. `equity`: which provides ownership rights to holders
2. `debt`: essentially loans repaid with periodic payments
3. `hybrids`: combine aspects of debt and equity.



## Trading Terminology

### Quote
A financial quotation refers to specific market data relating to a security or commodity. While the term quote specifically refers to the bid price or ask price of an instrument, it may be more generically used to relate to the last price which this security traded at ("last sale").

### Alpha
Alpha shows how well (or badly) a stock has performed in comparison to a benchmark index.

### Beta
Beta is the volatility of a security or portfolio against its benchmark index.
