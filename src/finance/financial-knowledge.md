## Secirities

Securities are fungible and tradable financial instruments used to raise capital in public and private markets. There are primarily three types of securities: 
1. `equity`: which provides ownership rights to holders
2. `debt`: essentially loans repaid with periodic payments
3. `hybrids`: combine aspects of debt and equity.
